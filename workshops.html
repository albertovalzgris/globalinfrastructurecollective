          This international workshop explored the "urbanization" of Chinese investments worldwide by gathering both
          established and early-career scholars who have been analyzing the topic in different regions of the world. By
          examining several locations and projects, the workshop opened a comparative perspective on the multiple ways
          in which China's economic and financial expansion is globally enacted, and discussed the methodological
          strategies that may best help the navigation of such complex geoeconomic and geopolitical transformations.
