        <h2>Global infrastructure and urbanization</h2>
        <div class="location-date">Turin, 11-14 June 2024</div>
        <p>
This four-day workshop, "Global infrastructures and urbanization: an exchange", held at the Interuniversity Department of Regional and Urban Studies and Planning, gathers scholars from around the world to explore the intersections of urbanization, development, and global infrastructure. Building on previous meetings in Malmö and Barcelona, the Turin exchange deepens collective reflection on the rescaling of the state, logistics, and the “urban” dimensions of global infrastructural transformations. Combining field visits, thematic sessions, and provocations, the event privileges collective discussion over individual presentation. It concludes with collaborative planning for future research and training sessions for early-career scholars. An optional field trip to Genoa introduces participants to Italy’s major port and key site of infrastructural investment.

        <h2>Silk Road cities and beyond</h2>
        <div class="location-date">Barcelona, 15-16 March 2023</div>
        <p>
This two-day workshop, “Silk Road Cities and Beyond: New Dialogues on the Urban Geographies of Infrastructure-Led Development”, held at the Institut de Ciència i Tecnologia Ambientals (ICTA‑UAB) from 15–16 March 2023, explores how China's Belt and Road Initiative reshapes cities across the Global South and North. It brings together scholars from Asia, Africa, Latin America and Europe to investigate  emerging urban geographies and political ecologies shaped by diverse large-scale projects from logistic hubs and ports to railways and digital corridors. Through plenaries, thematic panels and round-table discussions, the event offers a platform for fostering cross-regional dialogue on how new forms of connectivity and investment transform lives, spaces and natures. The workshop is funded by the María de Maeztu Unit of Excellence program.

        <h2>Comparative dialogues on the infrastructure-led urbanization of Global China</h2>
        <div class="location-date">Malmö, 21–23 September 2022</div>
        <p>
          This international workshop explored the "urbanization" of Chinese investments worldwide by gathering both
          established and early-career scholars who have been analyzing the topic in different regions of the world. By
          examining several locations and projects, the workshop opened a comparative perspective on the multiple ways
          in which China's economic and financial expansion is globally enacted, and discussed the methodological
          strategies that may best help the navigation of such complex geoeconomic and geopolitical transformations.
